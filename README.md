# pixel 4x corpus

A corpus of pixel art scaled up 4x, paired with vector counter parts. 

I am making this corpus available for machine learning / neural network 
training applications.

The corpus can be significantly augmented by rotation, colorisation,
composition, shfiting, recropping, and so on. for this I've included 
the larger source images from which I created the cropped versions.
